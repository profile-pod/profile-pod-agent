# profile-pod-agent

An agent created by [profile-pod-operator](https://github.com/profile-pod/profile-pod-operator) for profiling applications running inside pods in a simple way with low-overhead.

This is an open source fork of [kubectl-flame](https://github.com/yahoo/kubectl-flame) that was adapted for use by the operator.
